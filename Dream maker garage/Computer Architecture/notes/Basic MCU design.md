Some typical features on a PCB:
- Voltage Regulator (to maintain constant voltage)
- In Circuit Serial Programming Header (for programming)
- Polarity Protection (for protection of circuit)
- Noise Suppression (for protection of inputs/outputs, by e.g. decoupling capacitors and filters – electrically “dirty” vs “clean” components)
- Reset Button (to start the program again)
- Other Buttons and LEDs (can also use for indication/ debugging)
- Headers (for accessibility)
- Power Switch (maybe, for convenience)


Question from the class:
- Why are there some components having *maximum current rating* while others (such as capacitors) having *maximum voltage rating*? 
- Why do the diodes required to be put in the beginning of a power input?

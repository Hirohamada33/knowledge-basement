#### Logic gates

There are three fundamental gates: NOT gate, OR gate and AND gate. More advance gates, or complex circuitry are all based on the composition of these three gates. NAND gate, NOR gate and EXOR (or XOR, EOR) gate are advance gates. 

##### NOT gate

For NOT gate, it inverts the state of input. It is represented as $\overline{A}$
##### OR gate

For OR gate, the output will be 1 if any of the outputs is 1. This can be represented as $Z = A + B$.
##### AND gate

For AND gate, the output will only be 1 if all the inputs are 1. This can be represented as $Z = Aãƒ»B$.


##### NAND gate

##### NOR gate


##### EXOR gate

##### De Morgan's laws

De Morgan's laws state the equivalent forms for negations of AND and OR, which this transformation is widely used in complex circuitry. 
It states that: $${\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}{\overline {A\cup B}}&={\overline {A}}\cap {\overline {B}}\\{\overline {A\cap B}}&={\overline {A}}\cup {\overline{B}}\end{aligned}}}$$

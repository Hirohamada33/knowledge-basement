**CAN** stands for **Controller Area Network**, it was originally **automotive standard**, used for **industrial applications**. It has the following features: 

- Very prevalent automotive and industrial standard, suitable for medium distances (40-500m)
- Robust and reliable (safety critical systems)
- Built-in message priority and arbitration
- Typically up to 1 Mbaud  
- Half-duplex, asynchronous, 2-wire bus (one differential pair) â€¢ Very precise timing requirements compared with UART
- Complex protocol and controller

Some advantages of using the CAN bus are,
1. without CAN, each electric signal requires a signal line. Adopting CAN bus it simply replace the complex wiring to a singular signal bus, also reducing the cost of the wiring. 
2. Additionally, it has a great noise-preventing, so the communication can still be achieved within a difficult environment. 
3. Easy to add the nodes on the net.

CAN solution is targeting for a minimum latency, distributed control system.

A **state machine** or **finite state machine (FSM)**, is one model for computation in which a machine can be in exactly **one of a finite number of states at a time**. 
The state machine **transitions** between states in response to **inputs**. 

A state machine can be fully defined by:
- list of states
- initial state
- the input conditions which trigger each transition

The state machine may perform a number of **actions** during a transition. 

##### Classification
Moore and Mealy machines are two different forms of FSM. 

**Moore machines**: outputs are determined only by the current state
**Mealy machines**: outputs are determined by both the current state and the inputs. 

##### Benefits of using state machines

- A state machine can break down a **complex procedure or task** into **simple, independent units**. 
- For documentation purpose, it clearly **define the intended behaviours** including action, outputs, etc. 
- With a finite amount of states, itâ€™s easy to track which condition or transition caused some output.
- State machines are very maintainable; each state is independent so changes can be made to one state without affecting the behaviour of others.


##### Implementations

###### Enum

An enumerated type or `enum` in C allows you to declare a new type which has a finite number of defined values. 
The syntax is:
```c
enum identifier {
	VALUE0,
	VALUE1, 
	... 
	VALUEn
}
```

Just as with structs and unions, anonymous `enums` can be declared. Internally it is treated as integers, zero-based. But it should not be relied on. 

With typedef (see [[Type and memory manipulation]]), an example of an `enum` can be declared as:
```c
typedef enum {
    RED,
    GREEN,
    BLUE 
} colour;

colour my_colour = RED;

int main() {  
if (my_colour == RED) {
    printf("My colour is red.\n");
	}
}
```

The reason for using an `enum` type is that it is essentially a switch-case structure. This is useful in implementing a state machine with finite amount of states (`enum`). 

###### Switch-case statement

A switch-case statement is an alternative to using a large number of if-then-else statements. It has the declaration of:
```c
switch (expression) { 
	case VALUE0:
		// statements
		break; 
	case VALUE1:    
		// statements        
		break; 
	... 
	
	default:
		// statements
		break;
```

#### ROM (Read-only memory )
**Read-only memory (ROM)** is a type of **non-volatile memory** used in computers and other electronic devices. Data stored in ROM **cannot be electronically modified** after the manufacture of the memory device. Read-only memory is useful for storing software that is **rarely changed** during the life of the system, also known as **firmware**.
Although discrete circuits can be altered in principle, an integrated circuit usually requires new devices to be manufactured and to replace the installed device for error corrections or update of the program. 

###### PROM (programmable read-only memory) 
PROM are a form of digital memory where the contents **can be changed once** after manufacture of the device, so sometimes also referred as **OTP (One time programmable)**.  The data is then **permanent and cannot be changed**. It is a type of ROM (read-only memory), the key difference is from a standard ROM is that the data is written into a ROM **during manufacture,** while with a PROM the data is **programmed into them after manufacture**.

PROMs are manufactured **blank** and, depending on the technology, can be programmed at wafer, final test, or in system. Blank PROM chips are programmed by plugging them into a  **PROM programmer**. Companies can keep a supply of blank PROMs in stock, and program them at the **last minute** to **avoid large volume commitment**. These types of memories are frequently used in microcontrollers, video game consoles, mobile phones, radio-frequency identification (RFID) tags, implantable medical devices, high-definition multimedia interfaces (HDMI) and in many other consumer and automotive electronics products. A typical PROM device is made up of an array of **memory cells**, each made up of a **transistor**, which is a **bipolar transistor**, connected to a **fuse** called a **polyfuse** in the emitter of the transistor. A PROM programmer is used to **blow the polyfuse**, **programming the PROM**. 

A typical PROM will be **initialised as all bits as 1**. The programmer will burn the fuse and make physical disconnections to generate appropriate program code, however, this process is **irreversible**. Typically, this device uses **high voltages** to permanently destroy or create internal links (**fuses** or **anti-fuses**) within the chip.
Note that even when power is removed, it still retain its memory, making in **non-volatile**.  


###### EPROM (Erasable programmable read-only memory)
The memory can be written by supplying high voltage, and can be erased by exposing it under ultraviolet, for the next program. EPROM chip packages can often be identified by the prominent quartz window which allows UV light to enter. Usually it comes with a cover to prevent memory loss by accidentally exposed to sun. 
Repeated exposure to UV light will eventually wear out the EPROM, however, usually it has the endurance for over 1000 cycles. 



###### EEPROM 
**Electrically erasable programmable read-only memory (EEPROM)** is based on a similar semiconductor structure to EPROM, but allows its **entire contents (or selected banks) to be electrically erased**, then **rewritten electrically**, so that they need not be removed from the computer (whether general-purpose or an embedded computer in a camera, MP3 player, etc.). Writing or flashing an EEPROM is **much slower** **(milliseconds per bit)** than reading from a ROM or writing to a RAM (nanoseconds in both cases).




In each bit of the memory, the structure is very similar to a field effect transistor. A source, drain, control gate and channel. In addition, there is a floating gate, completely insulated from both side. 
The current that flows through the channel from source to drain is dependent on the net charge in control gate and floating gate. 
The channel will permit the current if the floating gate is holding a positive charge, and will block the current if the floating gate is holding a negative charge.



###### Flash
Flash memory can be erased and rewritten faster than ordinary EEPROM, and newer designs feature very high endurance (exceeding 1,000,000 cycles). Modern NAND flash makes efficient use of silicon chip area, resulting in individual ICs with a capacity as high as 32 GB as of 2007; this feature, along with its endurance and physical durability, has allowed NAND flash to replace magnetic in some applications (such as USB flash drives). NOR flash memory is sometimes called flash ROM or flash EEPROM when used as a replacement for older ROM types, but not in applications that take advantage of its ability to be modified quickly and frequently.

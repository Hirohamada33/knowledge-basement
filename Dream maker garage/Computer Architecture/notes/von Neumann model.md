**Five fundamental components**:
- **Memory (program and data)**
- **Processing unit**
- **Input**
- **Output**
- **Control unit (control the order in which instructions are carried out)**

There are two main properties that make von Neumann model successful, they are: 
1. **Stored program**
 - Instructions stored in a linear memory array
 - Memory is unified between instructions and data. The interpretation of a stored value depends on the control signals
2. **Sequential instruction processing**
 - One instruction processed (fetched, decoded & executed, completed & continued with next instruction) at a time
 - Program counter (instruction pointer) identifies the current instruction
 - Program counter is advanced sequentially except for control transfer instructions


An illustration of theoretical von Neumann model:

In this diagram:
- **Control signal** is represented as an white pointer. 
- **Tri-state buffer** is represented as a triangle. 
##### Memory Unit
Bits are logically grouped into bytes (8 bits) and words (e.g., 8, 16, 32 bits, depending on the architecture). It can represent program or data. 


###### Address space
Total number of uniquely identifiable locations in memory. 
Address space refers to the range of memory addresses that a computing system or a process can access. It encompasses the entire range of memory locations that are available for storing data and instructions. The size of the address space is determined by the architecture of the processor and the addressing scheme used by the system.

In a computer system, the address space is typically divided into several regions, including:
1. **Code Segment**: This region contains the machine code instructions of a program. It is where the executable code resides, and the processor fetches instructions to execute.
2. **Data Segment**: The data segment stores variables, constants, and other data used by the program during its execution. It includes both initialized and uninitialized data, such as global variables, static variables, and dynamically allocated memory.
3. **Stack**: The stack is used for storing local variables, function parameters, return addresses, and other information related to function calls and execution contexts. It grows and shrinks dynamically as functions are called and return.
4. **Heap**: The heap is an area of memory used for dynamic memory allocation, where memory is allocated and deallocated at runtime using functions like malloc() and free() in languages like C and C++.
###### Addressability
Addressability refers to the accessibility or identifiability of storage units (such as memory or external devices) within a computer system. It describes how the computer system identifies and accesses storage locations for reading or writing data.

Addressability typically depends on the hardware design and software support of the computer system. In terms of memory, addressability is determined by the number of address lines, which dictates the number of storage units the system can access. For example, a 32-bit system has 32 address lines and can therefore access $2^{32}$ (approximately 4 GB) storage units. Similarly, a 64-bit system has more address lines and can access more storage units.

**Word addressable** means the system can see a word (size dependent) as a unit of memory address.

**Byte addressable** means the system can see a byte as a unit of memory address. Usually a byte is commonly used in ISAs, hence byte addressability is also important for a system. 
![[byte addressing.png]]

In terms of instruction, if it is a word-addressable memory, the processor increments the PC by 1. If it is a byte-addressable memory, the processor increments the PC by the instruction length in bytes. 
###### **Endian**
There are big endian and small endian mode. 
- Big endian mode:
- Small endian mode: 
-

Although the convention does not really matter, it is important that on both side of the communication the endian mode should be agreed on. 



###### **Accessing memory**
To access the memory, the two ways are reading (loading) data from a memory location, and writing (storing) data to a memory location. 
There are two registers usually used to access memory: memory address register (`MAR`)
and memory data register (`MDR`)
**Read**:
1. Load the `MAR` with the address we wish to read from 
2. Data in the corresponding location gets placed in `MDR`

**Write**:
1. Load the `MAR` with the address and the `MDR` with the data we wish to write
2. Activate `Write Enable` signal â†’ value in `MDR` is written to address specified by `MAR`

##### Processing unit
The processing unit performs the actual computation. It can contain many functional units. 

**Arithmetic Logical Unit (ALU)** is one of the example of a processing unit. It deals with arithmetic and logical operation. 
![[ALU and operations.png]]
Usually it is represented as the symbol above. An example with a list of ALU operations is provided. 


**Fast Temporary Storage (registers)**
It is almost always the case that a computer provides a small amount of storage very close to ALU. 
An example is $((A+B)*C)/D$, the intermediate result of $A+B$ can be stored in temporary storage, since the interaction with memory unit for an intermediate can be a slow process (store and retrieve). This temporary storage is usually a set of registers (also referred as **Register File**)
The registers in the processing unit ensure fast access to values to be processed in the ALU.  
Typically one register contains one word (same as word length).

##### Input & Output
##### Control unit
A control unit conducts the step-by-step process of executing (every instruction in) a program (in sequence). Essentially a computer can be seen as a finite state machine, and control unit take cares of the transition of a state to the next. 

An **instruction register (IR)** contains the actual instruction bits to keep track of which instruction is being processed. 
A **program counter (PC)** / **instruction pointer (IP)** contains a memory address of the next instruction to be executed.

**Programmer visibility** refers to that the programmer can directly manipulate the storage or state. This marks the difference between microarchitecture and architecture, or simply hardware and software.

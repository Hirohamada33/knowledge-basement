##### Deep learning framework
Some major consideration of using a framework instead of starting from scratch is: 
- Easy to build large computational graph
- Easy to compute gradient from computational graph (i.e., backprop is automatically computed when forward pass is setup)
- Run it all efficiently on GPU (i.e., don't have to worry about low-level optimisation, etc)

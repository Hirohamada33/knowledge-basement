##### Loss functions
**Multi-class SVM loss**

**Softmax (Multinomial Logistic Regression)**
probability distribution
normalisation
exponential -> positive
All the mass on correct class
log is monotonic, easier to maximise
log is badness, add negativity to make it measure goodness



##### Optimisation

Markov process and Markov chain
is a **memoryless random process** (a sequence of random states with Markov property). 
The definition of Markov Process is that
- S is a finite set of states ()

Markov reward process (MRP)
is the Markov chain with reward. 

The matrix form of Bellman equation for MRP is given by:

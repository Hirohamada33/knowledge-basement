## Agile project management
The **user-end requirements**, or wishlists, are described as **product backlog**. 
Each features or backlogs are **broken down** in measurements of **hours** (or sometimes story points as minimal units). Based on the **remaining hours**, it can be graphed into a **burndown graph**, where it shows the **remaining work needs to be done** and the **rate of burndown** to indicates **potential completion date(s)**. 

There are some key principles of Agile project management:
- **Customer satisfaction** is **highest priority** through rapid and continuous delivery
- **Changes to environment** are **embraced** at all stages of development  
- **Product** is delivered with **higher frequency**  
- **Stakeholders and team** **collaborate closely** on a **daily basis**  
- **Face-to-face meetings** are the **most efficient** for success  
- A **final working product** is the **ultimate measure of success**  
- **Simplicity** is an **essential element**  
- The best **architectures, requirements, and designs** emerge from **self-organising teams**
- **Inspect and Adapt**

###### Benefits
- Can help **save time and money**  
- Can help projects where the **initial requirements are not clear**
- It is often easy to **rectify mistakes**  
- It requires **continuous feedback from the users**
- Easy to **cope with changes**  
- Easy to **measure productivity** 
- **Low overhead** in management processes

###### Disadvantages:
- Can lead to “**scope creep**” (sudden change of scope)
- Can be hard to **accurately estimate final project costs**  
- Requires **committed team members**  
- Usually only works with **small teams**  
- Tends to work best with **experienced** (Scrum user) **team members**
- Does not cope well if a team member **leaves the project**

While there are other types of management frameworks:
- The traditional approach
- PRINCE2
- Critical chain project management
- Process-based management 
- Lean project management  
- Extreme project management  
- Benefits realization management

##### Product Backlogs
**Product backlogs**, or ***user stories***, give an insight to the **requirements** and **features** of the final product. It listed all the **desired work** on the project, and ideally expressed such that each item has **value** to the users or customers of the product (or *features*). Generally it is **prioritized by the product owner**, and **reprioritized at the start of each sprint**

**Features** are different from **tasks**. **Features** (user stories) make up a **product backlog** and can be **demo** to client, while **tasks** are the **milestones** of engineers that the client couldn't sell / produce / manufacture the product, in another word, not a **front-end product** but rather just a **milestones**. 
##### Sprints
A larger unit of backlogs is **sprints**, where it is simulated as the **actual release** but with **lesser missions**. Usually before the actual due dates, there are **multiple sprint cycles** for an indication of (1) whether the project has **delayed**, and (2) breaking large projects into **smaller milestones**, which is easier in terms of **building prototype in time** and **debugging**. 

##### Daily scrum
**Daily scrum** is a method of discussion that is 
1. What did you do today?
2. What will you do today?
3. Is there any obstacles?
Some key features about daily scrum are:
- Typically **no more than 15 minutes**
- Usually **stand-up**
- **Quick**, **straight-forward**
- Key focuses are the **progresses** and **obstacles**

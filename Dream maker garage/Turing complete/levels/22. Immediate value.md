There is a requirement for moving an immediate value from program into registers. This is in immediate mode (`RED, RED`). 
When in immediate mode, bit 0 to 5 are for immediate values, which mean the maximum value for an immediate will be 63.

**Description**: 
In immediate mode, the instruction byte is interpret as `mode[7-6], immediate[5-0]`but no longer `mode[7-6], source[5-3], destination[2-0]`.
Here the decoder is disabled (when not in copy mode), and the data type is connected onto the data bus with a switch, activated only in immediate mode. This ensures that `REG 0` will received data when it is enabled. Notice that the tri-state buffer is well-controlled so that no other enable signals (from decoders and compute mode (only `REG 3`)) are enabled, ensuring (1) logical correctness and (2) no short circuit. 
Noticed that the immediate value is stored into `REG 0`, hence the save enable control signal is again `OR` with immediate mode. Hence the register will be store enabled when in immediate mode (always) or in copy mode (when specified as destination).

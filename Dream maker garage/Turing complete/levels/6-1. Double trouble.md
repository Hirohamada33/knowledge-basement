Output Green if 2 or more inputs are Green
#### Solution 1: Separate check 

![[separate check.png]]
**Description:**
Firstly the two **`XORs`** took inputs from pairs (1, 2), (3, 4) to check if they are different states. 
If they are, meaning there is one of them is Green out from an **`XOR`**. 
If they are not, meaning it could be either (G, G) or (R, R). With the OR gate, that one of the following is true:
1. One of the inputs is **`Green`**, from an **`XOR`**
2. Two inputs are **`Green`**, checked by taking an arbitrary input into **`OR`**. 
Considering (1) that there's only one input is **`Green`**, so an **`AND`** is used to combined upper and lower parts if (1) is true. 

However, note that it could be the case of (G, G, R, R) which **`XORs`** give Reds. 
So a second detection part (latter one) is used. It checks an arbitrary input from a pair, then compare it with **`XOR`** inverse output. 
It must be the case that the arbitrary input is **`Green`**, and **`XOR`** outputs **`Red`** so the inputs are **`Green`**, **`Green`**. 

Finally, any of the above condition will satisfies the requirement, so a three-**`OR`** is used. 

In simple words, 
The first part (**`XORs`**) checks there is a **`Green`** in **both** pairs. 
The second part (**`ANDs`**) checks if there is (G, G) in **any** pairs. 
(* the "pairs" are divided into (1, 2), (3, 4) in order.)

#### Solution 2, combination check

![[combination check.png]]

**Description:**
The solution checks the combination of each signal, and put into **`ORs`** to see if any combination works. 

#### Solution 3:

![[separate check - simpler version.png]]

**Description:**
A simplified version of solution 1:
1. Checks upper two if they are both **`Green`**
2. Checks lower two if they are both **`Green`**
3. Checks if (1, 2) and (3, 4) both has a **`Green`**. 

And combine the conditions by **`OR`** gate.

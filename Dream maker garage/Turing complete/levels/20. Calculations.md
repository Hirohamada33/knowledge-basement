Following the [[19. Instruction decoder]] where the calculate mode is given by `RED, GREEN`
In calculation mode, take `REG 1` and `REG 2` as inputs, and stored the output to `REG 3`

**Description**
Firstly, see that for destination and source decoders, if the input was given `000000`, it will identifies as `REG 0 (source), REG 0 (destination)`
So this can be done by using **decoder disable** - if the mode isn't in **copy** mode, meaning that the registers values do not need to be moved around, thus it connects the decoder disable bits: if the mode isn't in copy mode, then none of the load / save enable control signals can be activated.  
Secondly, in calculation mode the ISAs is using the last three bits to indicate `OR, AND, NAND, NOR, ADD, SUB` operations.

Hence the instruction byte was linked to ALU unit, with inputs from `REG 1` and `REG 2`**always output** pin (so it does not required enable). 
The output is linked back to data bus. However, since the output pin of ALU isn't a HiZ output, it is chained with a switch to ensure it is activated only if instruction mode was `compute` (same as tri-state buffer). 
In order to store the result back to `REG 3`, the save enable control signal is `OR` with compute mode, so it can be activated by either compute mode (always) or in copy mode (when specified as destination). 
A final remark is to see that the final two bits were using decoder for each instruction mode.

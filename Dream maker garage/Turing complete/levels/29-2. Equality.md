**Description**:
The idea of comparing of equality can be interpreted as "output zero when `input 2` subtracts `input 1`". 
Hence here two inputs are subtracting each other, using addition with two's complement. 
To check if the output is zero, simply check "if any of the byte is non-zero". (Here it is implemented with `OR` all the output, and `NOT` of the output)
Notice that the circuit will not have missed case due to overflow. The reason is that

Build a circuit that can save or load from 4 different bytes of memory.
There will be a bit to decide whether to load the data, and a bit to decide whether to save the data. 
Additionally, there will also be 2 address bits. 
From the first bit of information it follows:
`Load / Don't load`
`Save / Don't save`
`A / B`
`0 / 1`
`Value`

#### Solution:

**Description:**
The solution is a bit messy. The following graph is the simplification of the solution. 
Each address bit has been decoded into 4 combinations. For each load and save pins on each register, there requires a 3-input `AND` to determine (1) whether this is the correct address and (2) is the command be instructed. 3 inputs (1 for command, 2 for address) must all be activated in order to make the command. 
Hence, the combination gives 8 3-input `AND` gate, each gate for each instruction and each register. 

Secondly, 2 data bus line has been presented on the graph. Since they are in Hi-Z states, there will be no disagreement between values and easier for wire management.

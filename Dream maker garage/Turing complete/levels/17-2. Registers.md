In this level a circuitry is developed which copy the source to a destination. 
The instruction bytes gives the destination (bit 1-3) and source (bit 4-6).
There should be 6 registers, source and destination could be one of the six registers. 
Additionally, an external source and an external destination has been provided, which is enabled by both 7th bit on the 3-bit decoder.

**Description**:
In this tutorial the common practice of using a data bus is implemented. Here the data bus is shared among all the inputs and outputs, (source and destination pins). The reason for not short circuit is through considerate tri-state buffer setting, which as can be seen the control signal only sets one source and one destination at a time. 
Here the two decoders are used to give control signals, with first three bits are destination, second three bits are source. 
For each control signal, it enables the source (register load enable / input enable), and a destination (register save enable / output enable). Meanwhile other pins will be remaining Hi-Z state as they are not enabled by the control signal.

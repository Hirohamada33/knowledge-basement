Create a circuit that save or load the byte. 
When the first input is **`Green`**, load the memory and send it to output. 
When the second input is **`Green`**, save the input byte. 
The output has an enable pin, enable it only on load.

**Description:**
Similarly, each pin in a byte is saved / loaded individually. 
A new component `A bit of memory` has been employed, which has its first pin as save enable, and second pin as data to be saved. 
Here it simply just using use a byte splitter and operate each pin individually.

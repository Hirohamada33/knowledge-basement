**Requirement**: Using NOR, NAND, AND, OR, N

#### Solution 1, OR-ing states: 

![[always on - OR method.png]]

**Description**: By taking the **`OR`** of both **original state** and its **negation state**, it will always outputting **`TRUE`**. 

#### Solution 2, AND-ing states:
![[always on - AND method.png]]

**Description**: By taking the **`AND`** of both **original state** and its **negation state**, it will always outputting false. Then **inverse** this signal. 

It can be simplified as:

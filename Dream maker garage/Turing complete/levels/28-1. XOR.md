Using the Overtune schematic, compute the `XOR` operation by assembly

#### Solution
```python
# The input only appears for the first few steps
# read and store first 
in_to_reg0 
in_to_reg5 

# NAND
reg0_to_reg1
reg5_to_reg2 
NAND
reg3_to_reg4

# OR 
reg0_to_reg1
reg5_to_reg2
OR

# AND 
reg3_to_reg2
reg4_to_reg1
AND

# This is XOR
reg3_to_out
```

**Description**: 
Refer back to [[3. XOR gate]], that `XOR` is operated by `AND` the output of `NAND` and `OR` from two inputs. 
First read the inputs and save to `REG0` and `REG5`. These are `input 1` and `input 2`. 
Now operate `NAND`, save the output to `REG4`. Then `OR`, the output is stored in `REG3`. 
Finally operate `AND` from `REG3` and `REG4`, and `XOR` is operated.

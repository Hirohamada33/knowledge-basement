The first input is save enable, which saves the current value at the instance. The second input is the value to be stored. 
The output is always the value stored in the memory. 
(* the process hierarchy is output first, then store value)

**Description:**
The first input can be seen as the selection pin - a Green input will make a tunnel (by switch component) only in second switch (so the value is stored input delay loop), and a Red input will make a tunnel only in  first switch (so the value stored in delay loop is retrieved again). 

The second input, is the value to be stored. It only connects to the second switch as it is the switch that opens the tunnel when first input is Green.

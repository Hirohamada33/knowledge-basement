Create a device that saves the program output on even ticks, and output both bytes on odd ticks. 

#### Solution

**Description**
The solution follows the [[8-3. Odd ticks]] architecture. As can be seen a odd counter (`NOT` and `Delay`) is used as the control signal. 
To save the program output on even ticks, suggesting that a save mechanism should be used, 1~2 registers will be used for saving.
Here 1 register is used (for saving the first of two output bytes). Hence on odd ticks it should save and on even ticks it should output. Here `load enable` is connected with odd counter and `save enable` is the negation of the odd counter signal. This is byte 1. 
For byte 2 it can be controlled via a switch, and directly output from the memory. 
Here a data bus is used, connecting the `save value` of register and switch. Notice that register only save on even ticks so on odd ticks it will not receive input. 
Also noticed that on odd ticks, both register and switch are outputting.

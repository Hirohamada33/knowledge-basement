#### Solution 1, Masking method: 

![[second ticks - masking.png]]

Using **`OR`** and **`NOR`** along with **`AND`** will have a **masking effect of `FALSE`** for all cases. 
The only case of **`TRUE`** is when input 1 is **`TRUE`**, input 2 is **`FALSE`**. This can be configured by having **`AND`** of input 1 and **negation** of input 2 (**`AND`** allows consideration of both inputs)
Finally the **`OR`** allows the **new mask** to be added on top of all **`FALSE`** cases previously. 

Note that the **`OR`** / **`NOR`** mask can be simplified by **`OFF`** (ground) signal. 


#### Solution 2, input flipping:

![[second ticks - input flipping (NOT).png]]

As mentioned in **[[De Morgan's Laws]]** inverting the input will result in **mirroring** in the output table. 
From the desired output it can be seen that it is similar to **`AND`** and **`NOR`** truth table. For **`AND`** circuit, negating the second input **flips** the 1st, 2nd columns and 3rd, 4th columns. 
For **`NOR`** circuit, negating the first input **flips** the 1st, 3rd columns and 2nd, 4th columns.

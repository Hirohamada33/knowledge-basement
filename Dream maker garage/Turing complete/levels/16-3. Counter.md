Build a counter that will increase 1 tick each time. 
Additionally, there should be an option of overwriting the counter with a given value. 

First input is a bit, `count / overwrite` 
Second input is a byte, `overwriting value.`


#### Solution

**Description**:
The solution involves with "overwriting the counter value", suggesting there is a memory circuit. 
This solution uses a register, with a constant save and load (connected to `ON`). This `ON` is also connected to an adder which is treated as a single 1. The result of the adder is feedback into a multiplexer which allows overwriting of value, or just from the last result of the counter. Whatever values that is multiplexed, it will be fed into the register. 
Recall that a memory circuit essentially is a feedback for the input. In this example, a delay was created by a data bus and a feedback loop, so each tick the result can be incremented since last input.

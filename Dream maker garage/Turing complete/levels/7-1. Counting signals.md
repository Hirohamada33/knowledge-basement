Use binary counter to display the number of signals. The first digit represents 1, the second digit represents 2, the third digit represents 4. 
#### Solution 1
![[construction of three previous questions.png]]

**Description:**
It is essentially the construction of previous cases: 
For first digit (1) part, it display Green if there are odd number of signals. 
For second digit (2) part, it display Green if there are two or more Green inputs. 
For third digit (4) part, it checks if four inputs are all Green. 

A small issue here: 
The second part will output Green if two or more Green inputs presented. However, when the number of Green inputs are four, the second digit should be zero. 
So a NOR is used to ensure the second digit activates only when there is two or more inputs are Green, but the number of Green inputs is not four.

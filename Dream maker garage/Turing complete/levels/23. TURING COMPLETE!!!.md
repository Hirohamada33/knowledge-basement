The final mechanism before the well-known Turing completeness is to add the control flow in program counter when certain conditions are met. 
The condition mode is specified by (`GREEN, GREEN`)
In condition mode, the value in `REG 3` is compared with the condition specified in lowest three bits in instruction byte (`mode[7-6], none[5-3], cond[2-0]`)

The program should load the value in `REG 0` if the condition is met. 
Following is the list of conditions:

**Description**:
Here the condition machine `COND` is added into the architecture. 
The first byte is the condition (lowest three bits) and the second byte is the data input. The result is a bool (1-bit value) that states if the condition was true or false.

The condition is connected with the instruction byte (data bus), and input is connected with `always output` pin from `REG 3`. 
Here it can be seen that if the result was true, then it will connect to the overwrite enable (`0: increment / 1: overwrite`) control bit in program counter. The overwrite value is wired with `always output` pin from `REG 0`.

Notice that a 1-bit switch is used, since for `COND` it is constantly checking the conditions, where it was wired with two constant output components (`always output` of `REG 3` and data bus), hence it should only be enabled at condition mode. When enabled, the overwritten value can be true or false.

Outputs Green if there is only odd number of inputs is Green 


#### Solution 1: Different state checks

![[different state checks.png]]

**Description:**
The XOR outputs 0 if both states are the same (even signal) and 1 if both states are different (odd signal). 
It is further checked against if both pairs are different-state. If that's the case, it must be (G, R), (G, R) so there's again, even signals. 
The final XOR make sure that there's at least a pair is different-state while another pair is same-state. This ensure every Green output will only have odd number of Green inputs.

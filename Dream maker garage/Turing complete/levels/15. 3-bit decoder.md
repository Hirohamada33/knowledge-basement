**Description:**
A new component `1-bit decoder` has been employed. It can be used to switch / toggle the inputs. Its first output being the negation of input, and second output is the input state. 

There are eight different states for a 3-bit decoder - which is $2^3$. Here each combination is considered - the output 0 must have every input to be **`Red`**, so `AND` is used for each decoder negation state (first output), etc.

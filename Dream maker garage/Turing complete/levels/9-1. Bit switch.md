#### Solution:
![[bit switch.png]]

**Description:**
The new component (S) has an enable pin at the top.  If switch component is enabled, it creates the tunnel from input to output. Otherwise, it remains Hi-Z state that follows whatever signal is on the net. 
From the truth table, it can be seen as:
(1) If a signal (reminded that this is not the enable input) is enabled, it outputs the negation of its input state (from column 2-4)
(2) If a signal isn't enabled, it follows whatever state that is been driven on the net. 

So, it suggest that the circuit must be (1) symmetrical (2) output should be on the same net (but with Hi-Z state in disabled mode) (3) negating the input state. 

Hence, it has the architecture of (1) both sides are the same construction (2) output is connected (3) a NOT gate for negation, before the switch.

In this level it is to calculate $2 \times \pi \times r$ where $r$ is the `input` and $\pi$ can be approximate as 3. 

#### Solution 
```python
# 2 * pi * r = (pi + pi) * r 
# Iterate through the r from r to 0, keep adding (pi + pi)
in_to_reg5 # first load input
# iterate process
# Registers set up: 
# Reg 5 is radius counter
# Reg 4 is result storage

# adding process 
6
reg0_to_reg1 # prepare a 6
reg4_to_reg2 
add
reg3_to_reg4

# counter process
reg5_to_reg1
1
reg0_to_reg2
sub
reg3_to_reg5 # store result back to 5
# 1 # load jump address to reg 0
greater_than # if > 0, jump to address
# if not, then this is when r is zero
reg4_to_out
```
**Description**:
The basic idea is that for every iteration, the result is `result += (3 + 3)`. 
Here the iteration counter is radius, each time it is subtracted by 1 until it is 0 (if greater than 0, branch back to first instruction). 
So here there is adding process, where the result is retrieved from `REG 4: result storage` and added by 6 (from immediate), stored back to `REG 4`. 
Then it is counter process, where the counter is retrieved from `REG 5: radius counter storage`, subtracted by 1 (from immediate), stored back to `REG 5`. 
The branching will loop back to first instruction (where the `REG 0` happens to contain the value of 1). If the radius counter is 0, then output the result that was from `REG 4`

From this idea, it can be seen a blurry vision in multiplication operation.

In this level the input component has been replaced by a program memory. For every tick the PC counter must increment to proceed the next instruction. 
(Noticed that the branching is for [[23. TURING COMPLETE!!!]] level, will be introduced later)

**Description**:
Here a 8-bit counter is used, without any branching (refer to [[16-3. Counter]] but without the multiplex bit)

A counter is added one, with save and load always enabled. The output is then connected to program memory.

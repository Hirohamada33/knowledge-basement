Building on [[16-1. Logic engine]] now adding two instructions `ADD` and `SUB` into the circuit.

#### Solution


Firstly, addition is a process of adding each bit and introduce carries. This can be achieved by using bitwise addition. Luckily there is 8-bit addition

Secondly, subtraction is a process of two's complement of input 2. 

Here it can be seen that a decoder is used instead of multiplexer, as a tryout. 
The efficiency between decoder and multiplexers were to be discussed.

**Description:**
Here the first byte is the instruction byte. The instructions are:
`0 OR`
`1 NAND`
`2 NOR`
`3 AND`

Here a multiplexer is used, it serves similar usage to decoder. Notice that 3 multiplexers are used. 
The upper-left multiplexer is used for toggling inputs of `AND` and `NAND`, and the lower-left multiplexer is used for toggling inputs of `OR` and `NOR`. These are determined based on the **second** bit of instruction byte. 

Finally the right multiplexer is to toggle between the previous two inputs. It takes the **first** bit of instruction byte. 

Here, have a deeper look into each permutation from the instruction bits:

`00 OR`
`01 NAND`
`10 NOR`
`11 AND`

There's some observations:
1. Notice the second bits (LSB) are the same for both `OR/NOR` and `AND/NAND`
2. The first bits (MSB) toggle between the **negation** of each state. 
3. It follows that `OR -> NOR` and `NAND -> AND` in order. So one part of the circuit must be swapped. 

So, it can be seen that left multiplexers act like decoders (since the second bits remain the same) and the right multiplexer take inputs from left multiplexers. 
In simpler words, the left multiplexers take the MSB and right multiplexer take the LSB for toggling. 

The lower-left multiplexer is `OR/NOR`, it should be connecting to `0`(the first input in the right multiplexer). The upper-left multiplexer is `AND/NAND`, it should be connecting to `1`(the second input in the right multiplexer).

A final remark is that, notice for `AND/NAND`, the negated state of `AND` is connected to the first pin, while in `OR/NOR`, the negated state of `OR` is connecting to the second pin, which is what (3) is talking about.

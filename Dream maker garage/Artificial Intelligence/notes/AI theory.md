The key question in developing Artificial intelligence is, how do machine think?

To start with, there are several discussions:
1. How do humans learn?
   Reinforcement, expert guidance (supervision), repetition (with some variances and modification), generalisation, neural networking, observation
2. How do machine learn? 
   
3. Differences? 

##### Turing test
The **Turing test**, proposed by **Alan Turing** (1950), was designed as a thought experiment that would sidestep the philosophical vagueness of the question *“Can a machine think?”*
A computer passes the test if a human interrogator, after posing some written questions, cannot tell whether the written responses come from a person or from a computer.
The computer requires the following capability in order to complete Turing test:
- **Natural language processing** to communicate successfully in a human language;  
- **Knowledge representation** to store what it knows or hears;  
- **Automated reasoning** to answer questions and to draw new conclusions;  
- **Machine learning** to adapt to new circumstances and to detect and extrapolate patterns.
Turing viewed the physical simulation of a person as unnecessary to demonstrate intelligence. However, other researchers have proposed a total Turing test, which requires interaction with objects and people in the real world. The total Turing test also includes
- **Computer vision** and speech recognition to perceive the world;
- **Robotics** to manipulate objects and move about.

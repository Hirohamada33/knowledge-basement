Gymnasium is a project that provides an API for all single agent reinforcement learning environments, and includes implementations of common environments: cartpole, pendulum, mountain-car, mujoco, atari, and more.

The API contains four key functions: `make`, `reset`, `step` and `render`, that this basic usage will introduce you to. At the core of Gymnasium is `Env`, a high-level python class representing a markov decision process (MDP) from reinforcement learning theory (this is not a perfect reconstruction, and is missing several components of MDPs). Within gymnasium, environments (MDPs) are implemented as `Env` classes, along with `Wrappers`, which provide helpful utilities and can change the results passed to the user.

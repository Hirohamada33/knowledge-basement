|                     | Access | Insert | Delete | Search    |
| ------------------- | ------ | ------ | ------ | --------- |
| **Time complexity** | O(1)   | O(n)   | O(n)   | O(log(n)) |

**Access**: Since the hardware memory is a continuous addresses, the data can be access by **random access**. It can be seen that array has been used for the scenarios when data is plenty. 

**Insert**: When inserting an entry of data in an array, the first step is to check whether

**Delete**:

**Search**:

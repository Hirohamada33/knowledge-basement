Shell theorem is an important physics concepts in term of explaining a spherical symmetrical object that exerts / exerted a force to / from other object. 

In electric field:

Shell theorem 1: A charged particle outside a shell with charge uniformly distributed on its surface is attracted or repelled as if the shell's charge were concentrated as a particle at its center.

Shell theorem 2: A charged particle inside a shell with charge uniformly distributed on its surface has no net force acting on it due to the shell. This is because of cancellation of electric field due to each point / charge, from the spherical symmtry properties. This indicates that this charged particle is going to continue its static state or steady motion state.

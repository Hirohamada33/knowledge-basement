There are two ways of generating magnetic fields:

1. Moving electrical charge
2. Means of elementary particles (these particles have an intrinsic magnetic field around them)

It is known that the electric field is defined as $$\vec{E} = \frac{\vec{F}}{q}$$ where q is the test charge, E is the monopole electric field and F is the electric force. 

The difference between electric field and magnetic field, is that electric field could have monopole characteristic, while magnetic field always have N/S pole together, inseparable. Hence, the magnetic field $\vec{B}$ must be defined in a different way. 

After firing many charged particles through the point where B is defined, using different angle and direction to determine the force, the magnetic field can be described by the following formula: $$\vec{B} = \frac{F_b}{|q|v}$$
It is observed that the magnitude of the force is always proportional to v sin Φ. The formula is thus rearranged to $$\vec{F_b} = q\vec{v}\times\vec{B}  $$
and its magnitude is $${F_b} = |q|vB \sin(Φ)$$
where Φ is the angle between the directions of velocity v and magnetic field B.
Hence, it can be seen that the magnitude has its maximum at Φ = 0 or 180 (parallel and anti-parallel), and minimum (which is zero) at Φ = 90 or 270 (when v and B are perpendicular to each other).

Because the magnetic force is the cross product between velocity and magnetic field, the direction must be considered too. Using right hand rule, the hand sweeps from v to B and the direction of the thumb will be the direction of the magnetic force. Base on the charge of the particle, the direction will be out of the page / into the page for positive / negative charge respectively. 

Notice that $\vec{F_b}$ is always perpendicular to v and B. Which means that F never has a component that is parallel to velocity, and thus it cannot change the particle's velocity and kinetic energy. The force can only change the direction of v, in the sense that is the only thing that can contribute to the acceleration of the particle.
